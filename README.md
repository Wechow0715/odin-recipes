From this little project, I applied what I have learned about HTML from The Odin Project. Here is what I used to create my project:

The structure of a html file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Document</title>
</head>
<body>
    
</body>
</html>

Head, Bold text, Website title, size of wording, Ordered List, Unorderded List, Nested List;
Links to local directory, Links to website;
Adding pictures and fix picture size; adding description of a picture; fixing the postion of picture
