From this little project, I applied what I have learned about HTML from The Odin Project. Here is what I used to create my project:

The structure of a html file;
Head, Bold text, Website title, size of wording, Ordered List, Unorderded List, Nested List;
Links to local directory, Links to website;
Adding pictures and fix picture size; adding description of a picture; fixing the postion of picture.
