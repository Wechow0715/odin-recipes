    <p><strong>Chicken stew</strong> for dogs is a nutritious, easy-to-digest meal tailored to canines dietary needs—available as homemade or commercial options. Centered on boneless, skinless chicken (a lean, low-allergen, palatable protein), it’s a top choice for pet parents avoiding overprocessed kibble or addressing a dog’s specific needs. Unlike human stews (which often have salt, spices, or toxins like onions/garlic), it prioritizes safety and simplicity, with a soft texture that suits dogs of all ages. Vets also recommend it for dogs recovering from illness/surgery, thanks to its easy chewing and digestion.</p>
